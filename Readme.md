# Voice notes uploader draft

The draft of [Chrome compatible front-end implementation](https://github.com/karen2k/audio-upload/blob/master/js/main.js) of really long voice notes uploader.


The WAV output could be encoded to any other format via ffmpeg for example.


The simple Node.js back-end is also implemented to demonstrate the proof of concept.
